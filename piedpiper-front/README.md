Welcome to PiperChat! A full stack app that is functionally similar to WhatsApp. This application was built because of the fascinating ability of webrtc and all the possibilities it provides. It was built using React, Redux, Redux thunk, pusher-chatkit(for private and group messaging), webrtc(for peer-to-peer voice and video calls), socket.io(for signalling), node.js, and mongoDB.
